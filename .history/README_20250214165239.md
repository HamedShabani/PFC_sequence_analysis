## 📌 Overview

This repository provides Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for:
- **Loading and preprocessing** calcium imaging data.
- **Detecting and extracting** neural burst sequences.
- **Clustering sequences** and generating representative templates.
- **Analyzing and visualizing** the replay of task representations in the medial prefrontal cortex.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 📝 Notebooks

| Notebook Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Read_and_cluster.ipynb** | This is the first script to run. It loads calcium traces and detects and clusters the sequences. |
| **Get_clustered_seq.ipynb** | This script provides data for "Replay analysis." It loads clustered sequences (results of "Read_and_cluster.ipynb") and merges data of sampling, outward, reward for use in "Replay_analysis". |
| **Subsampling.ipynb** | Subsamples from sequences of learned data (equalized to learning) and redoes clustering for each session. |
| **Replay_analysis.ipynb** | This notebook loads data from "Get_clustered_seq.ipynb" and performs replay analysis. The output of this script will be used by "Replay_vis". |
| **Replay_vis.ipynb** | This notebook visualizes the results of "Replay_analysis.ipynb". |
| **Place_code_analysis.ipynb** | This notebook finds significant place cells/clusters. The output will be used by "Cluster_vis.ipynb" and "Cell_vis.ipynb" for visualization. |
| **Cluster_vis.ipynb** | Visualization for SI clusters. |
| **Cell_vis.ipynb** | Visualization for SI cells. |
| **Estimate_place_code_error.ipynb** | This notebook estimates the error of a Bayesian decoder. (Figure 1) |
| **Read_and_Cluster_sleep_and_arena.ipynb** | To exclusively save data of sleep, arena, or all data. |

### 📌 Functions

| Script Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **mtools.py** | Functions for `motiv` analysis. |
| **pftools.py** | Functions for place cell and cluster analysis. |
